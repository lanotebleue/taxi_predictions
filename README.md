Taxi Predictions



The aim of this project was to use historical data about the number of taxis called to the airport to create a model that will reliably predict the number of taxis that will be called to the airport in the following hour. The metric used to judge the accuracy of the model was RMSE.

I completed this project in Russian, but I will provide a translation to English in the future.
